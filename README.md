# VehicleBomb
## A simple vehicle bomb script written in LUA.

### How It Works
- To place a car bomb, do /placecarbomb while inside of a customs shop such as Benny's, LSC, or Beekers Garage.
- To remove a car bomb, do /removecarbomb while inside of a customs shop such as Benny's, LSC, or Beekers Garage.
- To detonate a car bomb, do /detonatecarbomb while within the set radius. If you're too far away from the vehicle you can't detonate the bomb.

### Install Instructions
- Unzip the VehicleBomb folder and drag it into your "resources" folder
- Add "start VehicleBomb" to your server.cfg
- Test if the script works
