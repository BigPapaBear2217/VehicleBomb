# VehicleBomb
## A simple vehicle bomb script written in LUA.

### How It Works
- To place a car bomb, do /placecarbomb while inside of a customs shop such as Benny's, LSC, or Beekers Garage.
- To remove a car bomb, do /removecarbomb while inside of a customs shop such as Benny's, LSC, or Beekers Garage.
- To detonate a car bomb, do /detonatecarbomb while within the set radius. If you're too far away from the vehicle you can't detonate the bomb.
